HOW DO I GET STARTED WITH MY SINATRA PORTFOLIO PROJECT?

Ideate! What do you want to build?
choose a domain you're familiar with!
choose a domain you care about
Wireframing & User Stories
Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
As a user, I can .....
A user should be able to .....
What does your app do?



 NOW, WE CODE! * but NO controllers or views yet *
Build your models
Migrations
Model classes
Associations (& validations)
Test your models and associations in the console
create some seed data
adjust migrations as needed
NOW, CONSIDER CONTROLLERS AND VIEWS
Start with your ApplicationController helpers - #logged_in? and #current_user
add your login/signup/signout routes
Build out controller routes for other models (add a controller for each model)

Build views and controller actions based on the flow of your app, one step at a time, testing as you go!

Use shotgun and pry (or raise/inspect) all the time!
